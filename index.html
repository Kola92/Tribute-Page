            <p>Martin Luther King Jr.(Michael King Jr.) January 15,1929 - April 4, 1968 was an American clergyman, activist, prominent in African-American Civil Rights Movement. His role in the advancement of civil rights employed the effective tactics of nonviolence and civil disobedience inspired by the teachings of the Indian civil rights activist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi</a>. The core theme for his campaigns and movements was against <em>"racism, poverty, militarism and materialism"</em>.</p>
            <h2>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h2>
            <p>King's urge to serve humanity started developing at an early age when he saw his father's proud and fearless protest against segregation, such as King Sr. refusing to listen to a traffic policeman after being referred to as a "boy," or stalking out of a store with his son when being told by a shoe clerk that they would have to "move to the rear" of the store to be served.</p>
            <p>King suffered from depression throughout much of his life. In his adolescent years, he often felt resentment towards the whites due to racial discrimination that he, his family and neighbours often had to endure in the segregated South.<br />
              King became known for his public speaking ability and won first prize in an oratorical contest during his junior year while attending Booker T Washington High School. A precocious student, he skipped both ninth and twelfth grades of high school.
            </p>
            <p>In 1948, he graduated from Morehouse with a B.A. in sociology and enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, from which he graduated with a B.Div. degree in 1951.</p>
            <p>King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they had shared responsibility as African Americans to bear <q>the burdens of the Negro race.</q></p>

          <div>
            <h2>LIFETIME WORKS AND CAMPAIGNS</h2>
            <p>In 1955, the renowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott" target="_blank">Montgomery bus boycott</a> incident which involved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks" target="_blank">Rosa Parks</a> being arrested for refusing to give up her city on a city bus was planned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Nixon" target="_blank">E.D Nixon</a> and led by King, this incident transformed King into a national figure and best-known spokesman for civil rights movement.<br><br> In 1957, King with other civil rights activist founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference" target="_blank">Southern Christian Leadership Conference(SCLC)</a> with the sole purpose of harnessing moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform, this was inspired by the crusades of the evangelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham" target="_blank">Billy Graham</a>. King capitalized on the purpose behind the foundation of SCLC which is organized nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation which led to an extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights and indeed he achieved the purpose as there were televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers, this sparked a wave of public sympathy which  convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.</p>
            <p>The SCLC started campaigns  all across the United States which spanned from Albany to Alabama, Florida, New York City to Washington D.C where his famous <i>"I Have a Dream"</i> speech was delivered. The Dream speech was delivered impromptu on the prompting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson" target="_blank">Mahalia Jackson</a> when he said "Tell them about the dream!".

            </div>
            <br />
            <p>The speech became known as greatest oratorical speech in the history of America and facilitated the passage of the Civil Right Act of 1964. King and the SCLC continued their campaigns to other parts of America collaborating with various civil right movement organizations.
            </p>
            <h2>OPPOSITION TO THE VIETNAM WAR</h2>
            <p>
              In 1965, when US started deploying combatant units to increase US military presence in Vietnam, King initially avoided public speeches on topics relating with the ongoing vietnam war, but he was urged by the former SCLC Director of Direct Action, James Bevel, who was at the time head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.<br>
              King spoke against the US role in the war criticising the US government as it was taking money which could have being used for social welfare like anti-poverty programs but rather money was being pumped into military defense, he also spoke of the need for fundamental changes in the political and economic life of the nation, and kept expressing his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice.<br>
              In his "Beyond Vietnam" speech he stated that "true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring."

          <!-- FINAL DAYS -->
          <div>
            <h2>DEATH AND ASSASSINATION</h2>
            <p>
              On March 29 1968, King was in Memphis, Tennessee to support the black sanitary public employees, whose workers were on strike since March 12 because of low wages and poor welfare of workers.
            </p>
            <p>King's initial flight to Memphis was delayed as there was a bomb threat against his plane. In reference to the bomb threat days before, King delivered his last speech as he addressed a rally with his "I've been to the Mountain top" speech at Mason Temple where he said:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.#cite_note-165">
              And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?
              Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              On April 4, 1968 at 6:01 pm, King was fatally shot by James Earl Ray as he stood on the second floor balcony of Lorraine Motel. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>
              After emergency chest surgery, King died at St. Joseph's Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he "had the heart of a 60 year old", which Branch attributed to the stress of 13 years in the Civil Rights Movement.
